If you would like your suggestion added here, please create an issue with details about your idea. No coding or art knowledge necessary. Discussion of particular ideas should happen in the Discord channel or in the suggestion comments.

### Recommended suggestion format:
Set the title to a concise yet accurate description of the idea.
```
Name:
Controller name: [ Admin | User | Char | House | Room | Home ]
Page name: (if applicable)
Description:
```
### How to choose a Controller (and when to make a new one):
Controllers are separated zones in the web page and show up after the `/`. For example:
`https://www.example.com/Admin/Page`

Controllers can be renamed in the ACP, but suggestions should refer to the default controller names. Additionally, the Home controller does not show up in the path. For example:
`https://www.example.com/About`

Controller | Description
---------- | ------------
Admin | Anything related to the Admin Control Panel. 
User | Anything related to User Control Panel.
Char | Anything related to Character Pages
House | Anything related to House information pages, permissions, rooms, moderation, etc.
Room | Anything related to temporary rooms.
Home | Chat-based options such as @mentions, text formatting, static pages (home, privacy policy...), etc.
